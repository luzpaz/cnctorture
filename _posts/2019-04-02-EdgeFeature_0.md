<!--more-->
Some edge features must be cleared by reducing the material to chips with a _pocketing_ style operation.  If these features represent a full-depth concavity, isolating and selecting them from the rest of the model is required.  This part gives a selection of edge features that the user might want to machine in isolation without doing a full-part profile.
- concave features
- convex features
- arc features
- corner features
