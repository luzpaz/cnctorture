This is a collection of test files for development of CNC/CAM operations.

#### 2D Examples
2D shapes for flat work including waterjet, laser, plasma, and pure 2D CNC milling/routing.

#### 2.5D Examples
3D solid models meant for 2.5D operations.

#### 3D Examples
Test shapes with difficult geometry. Bsplines, ellipses, etc.

#### Multi-object
Project files meant to test higher level CAM operations like part nesting, job layout, work-coordinate systems, etc
